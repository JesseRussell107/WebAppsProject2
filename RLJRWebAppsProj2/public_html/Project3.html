                        <h3>Gen Eds</h3>
                        <div> “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting— 
                            “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore! 
                            Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! 
                            Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! 
                            Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!” 
                            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.” <br>

                            And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting 
                            On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; 
                            And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, 
                            And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; 
                            And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor 
                            Shall be lifted—nevermore!</div>
                        <h3>Major Specific</h3>
                        <div>So, normally a section like this would be populated
                            by some kind of useful data, such as classes to take, how
                            many credits they are, et cetera.  But for this project,
                            we don't have to do any of that, so I have decided to take 
                            this particular moment to insert some inane drivel that 
                            someone somewhere will take the time to read really only
                            out of morbid curiosity. Or maybe no one will read this.
                            I mean, I could go on and on
                            about any kind of demented subject I wanted to, and I 
                            doubt anyone would even bother to try and read what I
                            wrote.  That, or, you know, I could write about some kind
                            of pure thing, like unicorns, or popcorn, or candy corn
                            or corn bread, or corn pudding, or acorns, or cornmeal, 
                            or tricorner hats, or corn flakes, or pizza.  I could 
                            also talk about Dr. Gallagher, and how he likes to take
                            a hammer and smash water melons in his free time.  I could
                            even sing for you! Laaaa, lalalalala LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
                            See? I have a beautiful singing voice.  But look at the
                            tomato. He can't sing. Poor tomato.  Say, you know what
                            tomatoes remind me of? Doorknobs! Man, I love me a good
                            doorknob.  I really like the ones at my Nana's house, 
                            with the handle and the curlies on the end.  My Nana makes
                            great cookies.  Better than Microsoft.  Microsoft's cookies
                            aren't edible.  But everything in this room is edible.  
                            Even I'm edible.  But that's called cannibalism, my dear
                            children, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies</div>
